# Ignacio Spreafico — Data & Business Analyst

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, showcasing **product analytics, experimentation, and data-driven decision-making** through a curated selection of real-world projects.

The goal of this portfolio is not to demonstrate tooling alone, but to highlight **how data supports better product and business decisions** — from defining metrics and designing experiments to interpreting results and communicating impact.
